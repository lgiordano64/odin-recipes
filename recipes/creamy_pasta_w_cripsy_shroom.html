            <li type="square">4 tbsp of extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li type="square">1 lb of mixed mushrooms (such as maitake, oyster, crimini, and/or shiitake), torn into bite-size pieces</li>
            <li type="square">Kosher salt</li>
            <li type="square">2 medium shallots, finely chopped</li>
            <li type="square">1 lb of spaghetti or bucatini</li>
            <li type="square">1/2 cup of heavy cream</li>
            <li type="square">Zest and juice of 1/2 lemon</li>
            <li type="square">1/3 cup of finely chopped parsley</li>
            <li type="square">2 tbsp of unsalted butter, cut into pieces</li>
            <li type="square">1/2 oz of parmesan, finely grated (about 1/2 cup), plus more for serving</li>

        </ul>
        <h4>PREPERATIONS</h4>
        <h5>Step 1</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large pot over medium-high.</li>
            <li>Cook half of mushrooms in a single layer, undisturbed, until edges are brown and starting to crisp, about 3 minutes. Give mushrooms a toss and continue to cook, tossing occasionally, until all sides are brown and crisp, about 5 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Using a slotted spoon, transfer mushrooms to a plate; season with salt.</li>
            <li>Repeat with remaining 2 Tbsp. oil and mushrooms and more salt.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Step 2</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and return all of the mushrooms to the pot.</li>
            <li>Add shallots and cook, stirring often, until shallots are translucent and softened, about 2 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Step 3</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until very al dente, about 2 minutes less than package directions.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Step 4</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Using tongs, transfer pasta to pot with mushrooms and add cream and 1 cup pasta cooking liquid.</li>
            <li>Increase heat to medium, bring to a simmer, and cook, tossing constantly, until pasta is al dente and liquid is slightly thickened, about 3 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Step 5</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove pot from heat. Add lemon zest and juice, parsley, butter, 1/2 oz. Parmesan, and lots of pepper and toss to combine.</li>
            <li>Taste and season with more salt if needed.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Step 6</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Divide pasta among bowls and top with more Parmesan.</li>
        </ol>
