            <h4>LECHE DE TIGRE</h4>
            <li>Set a fine-mesh sieve over a small bowl. Pur√©e first 4 ingredients and 4 large ice cubes in a blender until smooth. Add onion; pulse 3-4 times. Strain liquid into a medium bowl. Stir in clam juice, if desired; season with salt. Cover and chill.</li>
            <h4>CEVICHE</h4>
            <li>Pour water into a large pot fitted with a steamer basket to a depth of 1 inch; bring to a boil. Add sweet potato, cover, and cook until just fork-tender, about 30 minutes. Transfer to a plate; let cool.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, add more water to same pot, if needed, to measure 1 inch; bring to a boil. Add ear of corn to pot and steam until crisp-tender, 2-3 minutes. Transfer to a plate; let cool completely.</li>
